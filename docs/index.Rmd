# Introduction to the Project

In 2019, the American Statistical Association issued a statement decrying the categorization of *p*-values into so-called *statistically significant* and not statistically significant categories^[Wasserstein, R. L., Schirm, A. L., & Lazar, N. A. (2019). Moving to a World Beyond “p< 0.05”. American Statistician, 73(sup1), 1-19.]. They go further, and envision a world beyond '*p*<.05', and urge researchers to stop using the term *statistically significant* or any other categorization of *p*-values. 

However, moving into a *p*<.05 world may not be so straight forward -- categorization can fundamentally alter the way we perceive stimuli. In this project, we investigate whether the *statistically significant* category, entrenched in instruction and practice, has had an effect on our cognition, specifically the mental representation of probabilities as *p*-values, and if so, what effect it has had and strategies to remedy the effect.
